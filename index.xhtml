PaySwarm is the worlds first open, Universal Payment Standard for the Web. It 
makes payment a core part of the Web's infrastructure.
</p>
<p class="largeprint">
PaySwarm enables people that create digital content such as blog posts, music,
film, episodic content, photos, virtual goods, and documents to distribute their
creations through their website and <strong>receive payment directly from their 
fans and customers</strong>. If you have a passion for creating things on the 
Web, or would like to support people doing great things - PaySwarm is for you.
</p>
    
<p class="largeprint">
The platform is an open web standard that enables Web browsers and 
Web devices to perform Universal Web Payment. PaySwarm fixes the problems with
rewarding people on the web - it reduces and nearly eliminates transactional 
friction. It ensures that the people that you want to support are automatically 
rewarded for their hard work.</p>

<p class="largeprint">
This Web-native payment technology is designed to seamlessly integrate with
how the Web works, not how the banks and the credit card companies have
traditionally worked. The technology can be integrated directly into 
WordPress-based websites with support for Drupal and other content management 
systems in the works. It has a simple, well-defined API, like Twitter, that 
allows for Universal Payment on the web.

        <h2>Why PaySwarm?</h2>
        <p>
The way that we reward each other and pay for services on the Web is broken. 
There is a great amount of friction that is created between you and the
people you want to reward on the Web. People that are doing amazing things,
that are doing great work. Having to enter credit card information or login 
details is time consuming and monotonous. We should be able to spend a few 
pennies just as easily as we drop spare change on a table. We need to fix the 
way that we control and move our money around on the Web.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="threecol">
        <h2>Open Web Platform</h2>
        <p>
An open web platform is a combination of technology that is <strong>patent-free, 
royalty-free,</strong> published in a free specification, using well-defined 
protocols and other open technologies. The entire PaySwarm standard, like HTML, 
HTTP, and JavaScript, is an open web platform. Almost every successful Web 
technology  is built and released in this way.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="threecol">
        <h2>Micropayments</h2>
        <p>
PaySwarm supports Micropayments. The term micropayment is used loosely, 
as we don't want to bother the customer to reach for their wallet every time 
they need to spend a couple of cents, or even a couple of dollars. Micropayment 
in this case, specifically refers to the ability to automatically distribute
<strong>payments in increments of up to 1/100,000th of a cent</strong> 
to anybody listed in PaySwarm digital contracts.

      <h2>Communicate</h2>
<p>Much of the standardization work is done at the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) in the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/">Web Payments Community Group</a>.
There is an
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/">active mailing list</a>
where a good amount of technical discussion occurs. The group also holds
<a href="minutes">weekly teleconferences</a> with archived minutes and audio
from each meeting.

The PaySwarm community hangs out on Internet Relay Chat in the 
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/payswarm">#payswarm</a> channel on 
<a href="http://freenode.net/">FreeNode</a>. You can 
<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#payswarm">use a web browser to 
connect if you don't know how to use IRC</a>.
