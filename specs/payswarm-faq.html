      <p>
This document answers a number of frequently asked questions about the
PaySwarm standardization work.
      </p>

      <div id="what-is-payswarm" class="section">
        <h3 id="x1.1-what-is-payswarm"><span class="secno">1.1 </span>What is PaySwarm?</h3>
        <p>
PaySwarm is an open web platform standard that enables web browsers and 
web devices to perform micropayments and copyright-aware, peer-to-peer digital 
media distribution.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="what-does-payswarm-do" class="section">
        <h3 id="x1.2-what-does-payswarm-do"><span class="secno">1.2 </span>What does PaySwarm do?</h3>
        <p>
PaySwarm enables people that create digital content to distribute it through
the Web and receive payment directly from their fans and customers. It is
also designed to help fans and customers distribute digital content 
on behalf of the content creators in a way that is both legal and financially
beneficial to the creators, fans and customers. The technology is designed to 
be integrated directly into web devices, finally making legal digital content 
distribution a first-class citizen on the web.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="what-is-an-open-web-platform" class="section">
        <h3 id="x1.3-what-is-an-open-web-platform"><span class="secno">1.3 </span>What is an open web platform?</h3>
        <p>
An open web platform is a combination of technology that is patent-free, 
royalty-free, published in a free specification, using well-defined 
protocols and other open technologies. The combination of open technology
to accomplish a particular set of related tasks on the web defines an
"open web platform".
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="what-is-a-micropayment" class="section">
        <h3 id="x1.4-what-is-a-micropayment"><span class="secno">1.4 </span>What is a Micropayment?</h3>
        <p>
The term micropayment is used loosely, as we don't want to bother the
customer to reach for their wallet every time they need to spend a
couple of cents, or even a couple of dollars. Micropayment in this case,
specifically refers to the ability to divvy royalties and payments in
increments of up to 1/10,000th of a cent to various royalty and payment
accounts as listed in the digital contracts.
        </p>

      <div id="who-can-implement-and-use-the-technology" class="section">
        <h3 id="x1.5-who-can-implement-and-use-the-technology"><span class="secno">1.5 </span>Who can implement and use the technology?</h3>
        <p>
Anybody. The entire PaySwarm standard is implementable on a patent and 
royalty-free basis, just like HTTP [<a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-HTTP11">HTTP11</a>], HTML 4.01 [<a class="bibref" rel="biblioentry" href="#bib-HTML40">HTML40</a>] and 
Javascript. This means 
that anybody may implement any part of the system without worrying about 
technology licensing fees or patent suits from any of the participating W3C 
member companies.
        </p>
      </div>

    <div id="scope--goals-and-objectives" class="section">
      <!--OddPage--><h2 id="x2.-scope--goals-and-objectives"><span class="secno">2. </span>Scope, Goals and Objectives</h2>
      <p>
This section discusses the scope of the PaySwarm work while outlining 
short-term and long-term goals and objectives.
      </p>
      <div id="what-is-the-scope-of-the-payswarm-work" class="section">
        <h3 id="x2.1-what-is-the-scope-of-the-payswarm-work"><span class="secno">2.1 </span>What is the scope of the PaySwarm work?</h3>
        <p>
We are sensitive to the needs of the entire content creation,
distribution, payment, and customer ecosystem. This includes content 
identification and search (RDFa, Microformats, etc.), account crediting 
(credit card, PayPal, bank transfer, network-to-network cash transfer), 
identity management (OpenID, X509 certificate generation, validation and 
revocation), content registration, content distribution (physical point-of-sale,
web-based, peer-to-peer based), contracts and licensing, royalty
payments, coupons/discounts, dynamic pricing, and many other aspects
that are vital when considering the operation of such a system.
        </p>
        <p>
That said, it is important to have a sharp focus when performing good
standardization; the work must produce a tangible technology product. For
version 1.0, PaySwarm will focus on enabling web browsers to buy and resell
digital content among one another.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="what-is-the-objective-of-payswarm" class="section">
        <h3 id="x2.2-what-is-the-objective-of-payswarm"><span class="secno">2.2 </span>What is the objective of PaySwarm?</h3>
        <p>
The objective is to create a standards-based, patent and royalty-free
micropayment and content distribution platform that is capable of
meeting the needs of the digital content industries, web browser
manufacturers, content distributors and content customers. We are focusing 
initially on digital music, film and print media.
        </p>
        <p>
The long-term goal is to ensure that commercial content is directly
available for purchase via web browsers with a single button click.
        </p>
        <p>
The technology to do this is open sourced because we want to ensure that it 
is available for browser manufacturers to implement (patent and royalty-free).
        </p>

      <div id="what-will-the-end-product-look-like" class="section">
        <h3 id="x2.3-what-will-the-end-product-look-like"><span class="secno">2.3 </span>What will the end product look like?</h3>
        <p>
The PaySwarm web platform will be a collection of REST APIs that can be
implemented by web servers and web clients to enable the legal transfer
of digital content. The collection of REST APIs will mimic the tremendously
simple and successful API model used by Twitter, Flickr, Google, Digg and
a variety of other online services.

      <div id="how-does-payswarm-deal-with-online-identity" class="section">
        <h3 id="x2.4-how-does-payswarm-deal-with-online-identity"><span class="secno">2.4 </span>How does PaySwarm deal with online identity?</h3>
        <p>
Online identity exchange and management is something that has
multiple solutions online at the moment. Granted - they are not
integrated into the browser, but we have to pick the technology that
will be the catalyst for getting online identity management started. 
We think the PaySwarm API will kickstart more online identity 
standardization work at the W3C and thus online identity may be
better suited for the PaySwarm 2.0 work.
        </p>

      <div id="how-does-payswarm-deal-with-credit-card-processing" class="section">
        <h3 id="x2.5-how-does-payswarm-deal-with-credit-card-processing"><span class="secno">2.5 </span>How does PaySwarm deal with credit card processing?</h3>
        <p>
Checking account, bank card, online payment services and credit card 
processing are monetary transfer mechanisms that have
multiple solutions online at the moment. Granted - they are not
integrated into the browser, but we have to pick the technology that
will be the catalyst for getting card processing and financial transfer 
standardization work started at the W3C. We think the PaySwarm 1.0 API will
act as a catalyst to get the broader standards work related to inter-network 
financial transfer started at the W3C.

Where it is possible, PaySwarm re-uses a number of standard technologies for
digital content distribution. Here are all of the technologies that PaySwarm
is built on top of:

    </div>
    <div id="existing-technologies" class="section">
      <!--OddPage--><h2 id="x4.-existing-technologies"><span class="secno">4. </span>Existing Technologies</h2>
      <p>
This section provides arguments for standardizing PaySwarm over other
pre-existing technologies.
      </p>
      <div id="affiliate-systems-already-exist--why-do-we-need-payswarm" class="section">
        <h3 id="x4.1-affiliate-systems-already-exist--why-do-we-need-payswarm"><span class="secno">4.1 </span>Affiliate systems already exist, why do we need PaySwarm?</h3>
        <p>
While affiliate programs are one avenue for a blogger or website owner to 
sell content, what they really want is the ability to sell content directly
from their website without having to send their customers to an external
website - they want to create a solid online presence for their
community and affiliate links detract from that presence.
        </p>
        <p>
The PaySwarm system also allows website operators to set their markup fees
independently. With the system, content producers and distributors set
their fees and royalties independently and dynamically. The combined
total results in the final price of the product. This allows independent
control over the final prices on the network - which leads to market
efficiencies, while ensuring that royalties set by the content companies are
always respected.
        </p>
        <p>
Some bloggers may choose higher fees because of the strength of their
followers, others might choose lower fees because they are attempting to
attract more purchases from their site. The end result is that content
creators are always guaranteed the royalty amounts that they have set
for themselves, but you allow the bloggers to compete using different
payment models.
        </p>
        <p>
This approach is far more powerful than affiliate links because it
allows bloggers to have complete ownership over their site while
ensuring a steady royalty stream to the content owners.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="there-are-thousands-of-online-content-stores--why-isn-t-that-good-enough" class="section">
        <h3 id="x4.2-there-are-thousands-of-online-content-stores--why-isn-t-that-good-enough"><span class="secno">4.2 </span>There are thousands of online content stores, why isn't that good enough?</h3>
        <p>
While there are certainly many sites that already sell digital content
online, there is a larger issue that is of concern.
        </p>
        <p>
The goal of many W3C standards is to ensure that the technology is
ubiquitous and implemented in every web browser. Closed systems will
never be implemented in every web browser due to the nature of
proprietary systems. In other words, relying primarily on a few
retailers artificially constrains the avenues available to distribute and
monetize digital content. That is something that concerns both independent
content creators and large content creators alike.
        </p>
        <p>
There are roughly 1.7 billion individuals that use the Internet via a
web browser today. Those numbers will continue to increase as the mobile
device market expands. These markets are magnitudes larger than the
iTunes install base (50-70 million), or those who use Napster (0.8-1.0
million), or other online retailers.
        </p>
        <p>
The PaySwarming work endeavors to make every web browser and Internet
device into a point-of-sale and redistribution for digital content.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="it-s-easy-to-stream-digital-content-now--what-added-value-does-payswarm-provide" class="section">
        <h3 id="x4.3-it-s-easy-to-stream-digital-content-now--what-added-value-does-payswarm-provide"><span class="secno">4.3 </span>It's easy to stream digital content now, what added value does PaySwarm provide?</h3>
        <p>
While it is true that anyone can stream music or video on the Internet,
those organizations are struggling to create a business model that
is effective at getting their listeners to pay for a stream on a regular
basis without resorting to advertising or funding it themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
One of the driving reasons for this is due to most Internet radio
business models requiring monthly subscriptions or advertising. So, it
requires somebody to either pull out their credit card and put their
information into a site, or the station owner to have a fair amount of
knowledge about the advertising industry to make the station work.
        </p>
        <p>
If payment and streaming were integrated into the browser, the customer
would not have to pull out their credit card whenever they wanted to
listen to a for-pay stream - instead, they would set a spending limit
(perhaps on a per-site basis), and micropayments would flow out of their
account depending on what they were listening to on a song-by-song
basis. If they didn't want to spend money, their web browser could
request to stream several advertisements (if available), which would
then credit the listener's account. That credit could then be used to
listen to the stream.
        </p>
        <p>
We're focusing on developing technology to make this scenario easier for
browser manufacturers and software developers - to make it easier to
implement in a way that respects copyright while ensuring that the
endeavor is financially viable for everyone involved.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="there-are-already-digital-download-widgets--how-is-payswarm-different" class="section">
        <h3 id="x4.4-there-are-already-digital-download-widgets--how-is-payswarm-different"><span class="secno">4.4 </span>There are already digital download widgets, how is PaySwarm different?</h3>
        <p>
There are certainly mechanisms out there that allow one to pair
up with one or two proprietary services in order to provide downloads
directly from one's website. The downside with that approach is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
The solution is proprietary, which means that web browsers will never
integrate the approach into their user interfaces. Proprietary
solutions have a hard time gaining wide acceptance. Alternatively,
open solutions like HTML, Javascript and HTTP have gained wide
acceptance. That's not to say that you cannot be successful, like
Adobe has with Flash, but rather to point out that open standards
more often lead to deeper market penetration.
          </li>
          <li>
It requires the blogger to choose a handful of companies, each with
their own login and payment processing requirements. If the blogger
wants to sell music, movies and books - they may have 3 music
providers, 2 movie providers and 4 book providers. The APIs and
user accounts would differ between these providers, which would not
only make implementation more difficult, but would also make the
customer experience aggravating (especially if you don't have or
want an account with one of those services).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
The underlying point to all of this is that while it may be possible to
solve the problem using a proprietary solution with a proprietary vendor
- the ideal solution is to follow what has made the web successful. That
is, define an open standard for doing these sorts of transactions. There
are a great number of halo effects that occur from standardization - to
come back to this example, three of those effects would be:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
You wouldn't need a widget of any kind to enable the scenario
because the web browser has the ability to purchase content from
anybody that provides the PaySwarm API.

This section covers how licensing, copyright and other legal concerns will

        <p>
There is a great deal of complexity involved with licensing, royalty 
collection, and financial account management. That is why there is the 
concept of a "PaySwarm Authority" in the network. 
The PaySwarm Authority is the trusted platform vendor that processes all of the 
credit card transactions, royalty collection and distribution, identity 
verification, and the other necessary services provided by a trusted platform 
vendor. These are the companies that license digital content from the content 
creators.
        </p>
        <p>
The bloggers, radio stations and other digital content distributors use
the trusted platform vendors as their PaySwarm Authority - which allows the 
network to be open, but payment and royalty collection/distribution to remain 
secure.
        </p>
        <p>
The PaySwarm work is focused on ensuring interoperability between the
browsers and the PaySwarm Authority at the moment. Future work will focus on
interoperability between multiple PaySwarm Authorities. PaySwarm Authority 
interoperability would allow a customer to have multiple financial accounts at 
multiple PaySwarm Authority locations and authorize payment from one 
PaySwarm Authority to another in a standards-compliant way.

        <p>
Yes, it is possible to transact only licenses on the PaySwarm network. This
is useful when the data is readily available, but a special license must be
acquired for a different use of the data. For example, if a videographer 
purchases a song for personal use and then they find a use for that same song in
one of their videos. A separate license for use in a video could be negotiated
and purchased using PaySwarm.
        </p>
        <p>
Alternatively, if a CAD file is purchased for manufacturing but the license
dictates that each manufactured item have a unique serial number assigned to it,
the license could express a digitally signed, unique serial number that would
be embedded in the manufactured part (such as through an RFID tag).

        <h3 id="x5.3-does-the-system-rely-on-drm-to-protect-the-files"><span class="secno">5.3 </span>Does the system rely on DRM to protect the files?</h3>
        <p>
PaySwarm does not depend on any sort of proprietary DRM mechanism to 
provide a secure content transfer and payment mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
The PaySwarming technology can steganographically watermark every file
sold with a unique key in a way that we believe does not violate any
patents. If a file containing one of these keys is found on a network,
it can be traced back to the owner. This provides an incentive to not
upload such a file to a file sharing network that is not aware of
licensing or copyright.
        </p>
        <p>
The watermarking is accomplished via a module called the Binary File
Processor (BFP). The PaySwarm standard defines this as an opaque module
that should be downloaded from the PaySwarm Authority. The BFP is used to 
provide DRM services if necessary, but leaves implementation of this up to the 
PaySwarm Authority provider.
        </p>
        <p>
While watermarking is a viable incentive, the greater incentive for
respecting copyright will be that individuals can receive payment for
being part of the content distribution vehicle. This is accomplished
without cannibalizing the content creator's royalty.
        </p>
        <p>
We believe that it is possible to implement the PaySwarm system without
entering the DRM patent thicket. However, we also ensure that there is a
mechanism to provide DRM services, the BFP, if a PaySwarm Authority provider 
wishes to do so.

        <h3 id="x5.4-resale-can-t-work-with-digital-content--can-it"><span class="secno">5.4 </span>Resale can't work with digital content, can it?</h3>
        <p>
The term "resale", when it is used in the context of PaySwarming, 
doesn't mean a transfer of license from one owner to another, but rather an 
additional download source for the content.
        </p>
        <p>
We don't believe that customer-focused license transfers make sense for
digital content due to the ease of digital copying - and thus, the
concept is not currently supported in PaySwarm. We have some ideas on
how this might work for particular industries in the future (such as
physical goods manufacturing), but those concepts are not ready for
standardization.
        </p>
        <p>
Here's an example of "resale" on PaySwarming:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
Customer Q buys a song via their favorite music blog site by downloading from 
a PaySwarm network.
          </li>
          <li>
The PaySwarm Authority assigns the license and collects royalties from customer 
Q.
          </li>
          <li>
Customer Q then puts their song up for "resale" on the network,
which adds them to the pool of available sellers.
          </li>
          <li>
Customer R starts to purchase the same song Q bought.
          </li>
          <li>
Customer Q is chosen as one of the download sources for the file and
is remunerated accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
The PaySwarm Authority assigns a new license and collects royalties from 
customer R.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
At this point, both Q and R have licenses - which were acquired by
paying the record label a royalty for each song sold. Q has also been
paid a data transfer fee for providing a download source for R.
        </p>
        <p>
To be clear, every time a song is sold on a PaySwarm network, the record
label receives the royalty amount that they set for a license sale. The
record label is /always/ paid the royalty they set for each song sale.
