      <p>
Digital content piracy has been a significant disruption to the
operation of the Web for over a decade. While this is partially due to a
number of factors that are outside of the control of standards bodies,
there remains one key oversight that the standards organizations could
address that would enable new business models via the Web while reducing
the incentive to illegally disseminate digital files. If Alice has a MP3
song that she would like to give Bob, there should be a simple mechanism to
enable the legal duplication of that copyrighted work from Alice to Bob.
There should be a standard mechanism for the legal exchange of commercially
viable digital content.
      </p> 
 
      <p>
At present, digital media sales on the Web is largely a producer to
consumer model. Typically, sites like Apple iTunes, Amazon Music, Netflix,
the Microsoft Zune store and other digital retailers create proprietary,
Web-based store fronts to sell digital products to their customers. During
the product sale, the item is either wrapped in Digital Rights Management
technologies in an attempt to curb piracy or restrictively licensed only to
the individual purchasing the digital good. This is strictly a
corporation-to-consumer experience.
      </p> 
 
      <p>
There currently is no secondary market for digital content sales due to
the nature of digital media - reproducing a digital file is incredibly
fast, cheap and easy. This fact has lead to a great amount of digital
piracy, notably by peer-to-peer network technology such as Napster,
BearShare, Morpheus, Gnutella, Kazaa and BitTorrent. While iTunes has
claimed to make as many as 435,164 video sales per day through their store,
the number of video downloads per day over Mininova, one of the largest
BitTorrent networks (2008), approach close to 4,975,075 downloads per day.
Close to ten times as much video traffic is served through a single
BitTorrent community versus the number two digital video sales service in
the world.
      </p> 
 
      <p>
While it is still fairly unknown how much DRM, industry tactics, value
proposition, platform access, file formats, convenience and digital
kleptomania contribute to piracy - it can be said that each is a
contributor to piracy in todays digital media ecosystem. By addressing some
of the use cases outlined in this document, we may be able to address the
following key areas that are currently overlooked by the major players:
value proposition, platform access, file formats, and convenience. The
end-goal is to create a standards-based peer-to-peer network, driven by
open, flexible standards, that allow customers to help artists, production
companies and creators of content to distribute digital goods in exchange
for financial compensation. Just as physical storefronts help to distribute
products on behalf of their manufacturers, digital storefonts can help to
distribute content on behalf of their creators.
      </p> 
 
      <p>
Providing a standard mechanism for web browsers to exchange digital
goods in exchange for monetary compensation would provide a much needed
core feature of the Web that has been a demonstrated need for over a
decade.

<p>Jude blogs about music and movies and has achieved a respectable
following of people that read his blog. He would like to sell content that
he writes about to his many readers, but doesn't have the music and movie
industry connections to acquire content for distribution. Typically,
content deals require an multi-million dollar, advance payment in return
for the right to sell content. This high up-front cost removes many
potential sellers, harming the overall incentive to distribute for people
that run smaller music websites and blogs.</p> 

<p>There are many existing clearing houses for content on the web today. If
those clearing houses were able to manage artist content, content creators
could use the clearing house to setup the distribution rights for their
content. Smaller content distributors, like Jude, could then offer content
to their site visitors without worrying about the high-cost or management
overhead associated with managing content catalogs.</p>

      <ul> 
        <li>The content distributor (blogger) can be a separate entity from
        content owner (musician/label/production company).</li> 
     
        <li>The content distributor must be able to distribute content without
        the content owners knowledge as long as the distribution license and
        royalty payments arerespected.</li> 
     
        <li>The content distributor must be able to set distribution prices
        independently of the content provider.</li>

<p>Jane, who is an independent film maker, has just finished her
documentary and wishes to distribute it to a very large audience. She does
not have the resources to provide High-Definition streaming of her content
to her fans. She would also like to charge enough for the current
documentary in order to cover the production costs of the next documentary.
She could use BitTorrent to distribute her work, but it lacks the ability
to collect payment on her behalf. She would like to give some of the
proceeds of each sale to those that will help her distribute her
documentary.</p> 

<p>Ideally, Jane would register her work with a content clearinghouse. That
clearinghouse would provide the reference file which would be used to seed
the network. Once enough downloads have been performed, others on the
network could distribute the file in exchange for monetary compensation for
providing a download source.</p>

<p>Tellulah is a DJ and would like to setup a non-profit Internet radio
station to stream Weekly Top 40 songs along with a mix of independent
music. She would like to cover her expenses as well as the standard
per-song ephemeral broadcasting fee set by the US Copyright Arbitration
Panel to ensure she is legally compliant at all times. Registering and
tracking royalties can be a very daunting and time consuming process. A
mechanism that reduces the burden of legal compliance could drive more
stations to come online.</p> 

<p>Online radio broadcasters are also presently limited in their ability to
grow their stations due to the ephemeral broadcasting royalties that must
be paid on a per person/per song basis. Running these stations make it
difficult to collect, track and distribute royalties in a way that makes it
easy to integrate into the web browser. Often, donating or signing up to a
single download provider can be more trouble than it is worth. If there was
a universal mechanism to pay very small amounts for data streams on the
Web, new legal avenues for distributing content legally would be
enabled.</p>

      <ul> 
        <li>Payment must be able to be associated with a section of a stream of

<p>Joss directs and produces a number of excellent television shows. Over
the years, he has garnered a strong online following but doesn't have the
required numbers for a long television production run. He would like to
distribute his shows via the Web. Joss would like to partner with an
advertising network to provide audio and video advertisements to cover the
costs related to the production and distribution of his shows. In order to
do this, the system that he uses must be able to credit and debit payment
accounts accordingly whenever advertising is inserted into the content
stream.</p> 

<p>When a fan watches each episode, they can opt to pay for the episode in
full, pay for reduced advertisements, or request that advertisers cover the
entire cost of the show. Advertisers can choose to provide small payments
for anonymous advertisements, or larger payments if customers provide
advertising details and preferences to the advertisers.</p> 

    <div id="requirements-3" class="section">

      <ul> 
        <li>Network participants should be allowed to credit other accounts on
        the network. For example, buyers should be allowed to ask other network
        participants (advitisers) to partially cover their costs in exchange for
        the insertion of ads into the data stream.</li>

<p>Lars would like to ensure that the purchase process for a digital good
is streamlined as much as possible into the web browser that he has
created. When somebody uses the web browser, he would like to display a
"Buy" button in the address bar. The media details such as the title of the
work, the price and the details required to perform a swarming purchase
would be lifted from the web page.</p> 

<p>The purchase process would be as simple as the buyer clicking the Buy
button and watching a download progress dialog appear on the screen.
Account and payment details could be stored in the web browser to ease the
purchase process. Not bothering the person browsing for payment details
would be especially useful in scenarios where very small payments were
needed to access content.</p> 
 
    <div id="requirements-4" class="section">
      <h3 id="x6.1-requirements"><span class="secno">6.1 </span>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>Content details should be able to be expressed in a Web page such
        that a user agent can extract the details for a piece of digital
        content.</li> 
     
        <li>All relevant payment details should be expressed in a Web page such
        that a user agent may purchase content after detecting the payment
        processing details on a page.</li>

<p>Gregor runs a fairly active high-definition movie download site. His
data transmission prices are high during peak hours and low during off-peak
hours. He would like to give his customers the option to negotiate for
lower download prices if they download their movies during the off-peak
times. He would also like to reserve the right to refuse a contract
re-negotation attempt if he has not made a pre-set sales quota and even
raise his prices if it would make sense for his business.</p> 

<p>The ability to change prices based on market demand would enable a more
dynamic marketplace, leading to more competition between download
providers. Giving buyers the ability to re-negotiate terms of sale would
not only give them a sense of empowerment, but could eliminate bad pricing
behavior on the network, leading to overall market efficiencies.</p> 

    <div id="requirements-5" class="section"> 
      <h3 id="x7.1-requirements"><span class="secno">7.1 </span>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>The system should allow buyers and sellers to negotiate the data
        download prices associated with a particular download.</li> 
     
        <li>The system could allow buyers to negotiate the license details as
        well as the license price with a particular content creator.</li>

<p>The Association of Science Journalists Conference would like to present
a series of live keynotes by luminaries in their respective fields. The
presentations would be open to conference attendees or those that pay for a
virtual day pass for the conference. The license could be purchased
separately and then could be used to access a number of multicast sources
that play at different times. Remote access to journalists would be granted
at a different payment rate than non-members.</p> 

<p>It is important that a separation is made between the content license
and the download contract. The content license specifies usage and access
rights. The download contract specifies the download negotiables, such as
payment rate, speed and other details associated with the data stream. By
separating the two concerns, we can allow network specialization to occur
between those that would grant licenses for digital content and those that
would deliver digital content. Ensuring that both could operate
semi-autonomously would allow semi-independent optimization of market
variables.</p>

<p>Since Luciano's browser was used to make the purchase, it has a digitally
