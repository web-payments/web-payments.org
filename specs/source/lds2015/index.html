This specification describes a standard signature suite created in 2015 for the
Linked Data Signatures specification.

This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It
is not fit for production deployment.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes a standard signature suite created in 2015 for the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. It uses the RDF
Dataset Normalization Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] to transform the
input document into its normal form. It uses SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] as the
<a>message digest algorithm</a> and RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 [[RFC3447]] as the
<a>signature algorithm</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of the Linked Data Signature 2015
<a>signature suite</a>.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a normalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>normalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one possible
representation and always transforms it into a normal form. This process is
sometimes also called canonicalization.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>message digest algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces a cryptographic
output message that is often times many orders of magnitude smaller than the
input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
non-reversible, 3) change when even one bit of the input message changes, and
4) produce different outputs for different inputs.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value where the
receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the message came from
a particular sender and has not been modified in transit.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>The Linked Data Signature 2015 Signature Suite</h2>

      <p>
The Linked Data Signature 2015 <a>signature suite</a> MUST be used in
conjunction with the signing and verification algorithms in the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. The suite consists of
the following algorithms:

      <table class="simple">
        <thead>
          <th>Parameter</th>
          <th>Value</th>
          <th>Specification</th>

            <td>[[RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]]</td>
          </tr>

      <h2>Modification to Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
No modifications to the Linked Data Signature algorithms are provided other
than the algorithms specified in the previous signature suite section.

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <p>
The following section describes security considerations that developers
implementing this specification should be aware of in order to create secure
software.
