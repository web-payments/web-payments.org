The purpose of the Web Payments Community Group at the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to create systems that enable people 
and businesses on the Web to send each 
other money as easily as they exchange instant messages and email today. The 
systems strive to be easy to use, currency agnostic, secure, decentralized and 
implementable by anyone in a patent and royalty-free manner. The group is 
focusing on transforming the way we reward each other on the Web as well as 
how we organize financial resources to enhance our personal lives and 
pursue endeavors that improve upon the human condition. The following use
cases outline the basic functionality that the group is attempting to
achieve.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
    <p>
The Web continues to transform the way humankind communicates and builds
our world. At the heart of most of these endeavors is the exchange of
value. Gifts, attention, and payments each play a role in the ecosystem
that we call the economy. Until now, there has been no open and
universal way of sending and receiving payments on the Web through your
browser. This is why people are still compelled to reach for their
credit card or log into a payment site when purchasing something over
the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
There are a number non-interoperable payment solutions today. This
document outlines use cases that are supported by existing payment
solutions today, and also outlines innovative use cases that could be
supported in the future by a universal payment mechanism to enable next
generation mobile payments, alternative currencies, crowd-sourced
investing, next-generation banking, and electronic commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
This specification outlines use cases that are enabled by universal
payment for the Web. The goal of addressing the use cases as a whole is
to create a safe, decentralized system and a set of open, patent and
royalty-free specifications that allow people on the Web to send each
other money as easily as they exchange instant messages and e-mail
today. Addressing these scenarios will transform the way we reward each
other on the Web as well as how we organize financial resources to
enhance our personal lives and pursue endeavors that improve upon the
human condition.

    <h2>Glossary</h2>
  
    <p>
There is certain terminology used throughout this document that has a very
specific meaning. In order to state explicitly what that meaning is, the 
following definitions are provided:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>entity</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a thing with distinct and independent existence such as a person, organization,
or instance of a software program.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of information about an 
<tref title="entity">entity’s</tref> background such as a name, government ID, 
<tref>payment processor</tref>, home address, or university degree.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>transaction</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a transfer of value from one <tref>entity</tref> to another.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>digital receipt</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a proof of purchase that verifies that a particular <tref>entity</tref> was 
involved in a <tref>transaction</tref>.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Roles</h2>
  
    <p>
Each interaction in a Web Payments scenario involves a number of 
<tref title="entity">entities</tref>. In order to make it clear who the
actors are, the following roles are defined:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>payer</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
the <tref>entity</tref> sending value in a <tref>transaction</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>payee</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
the <tref>entity</tref> receiving value in a <tref>transaction</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>buyer</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> purchasing a product or service.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>merchant</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that is offering a product or service for sale.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>payment processor</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that is responsible for transferring value between 
<tref title="entity">entities</tref> and 
generating verifiable <tref title="digital receipt">digital receipts</tref>.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Credentials</h2>
  
    <p>
In order to interact, an <tref>entity</tref> may require one or more pieces 
of information from another entity. Each of these pieces of information, which 
may be digitally signed by a 3rd party, are called a <tref>credential</tref>. 
The following credentials are commonly used throughout this document:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>identity credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
An identity <tref>credential</tref> contains a pseudo-anonymous URL that can
be used to uniquely identify an <tref>entity</tref>. The URI typically doesn't
contain any personally identifiable information.
      </dd>

      <dt><tdef>email credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
An email <tref>credential</tref> contains a verified email address and proves 
that the <tref>entity</tref> associated with the credential has verified their
email address with a 3rd party.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>payment processor credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
A <tref>payment processor</tref> <tref>credential</tref> contains a verified 
payment processor URL that was assigned to the <tref>entity</tref> associated 
with the credential by their payment processor.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>shipping address credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
A shipping address <tref>credential</tref> contains a verified address where
shipping deliveries may be made that is also associated with the
<tref>entity</tref> associated with the credential. Typically, organizations
that are capable of associating a shipping address with an <tref>entity</tref>,
such as the United States Postal Service, provide these credentials.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
  
    <p>
When exploring systems design, there are concepts that clearly fit into use 
cases and concepts apply to all use cases. We are calling the latter class of
concepts <em>design criteria</em>, which are goals that should be kept in mind
while designing the overall web payments system.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h2>Web Intents / Protocol Handlers</h2> 
   
      <p>
Consider using a Web Intents or Protocol Handler-like mechanism
to provide an abstraction layer that could be used to solve both payment 
initiation and other problems on the Web.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Trisha signs up with a new payment processor service, and during the
registration, the service asks if it may be used to process the 
"buy:" intent/protocol.
          </li>
          <li>
Ravi finishes placing all the items to buy into his shopping cart, when
he clicks the "Pay" button, the "buy:" intent/protocol handler is initiated, 
resulting in a UI flow that requests that he picks which of his payment
processors he'd like to use for the purchase.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section> 
        <h3>Details</h3> 
        <p>
Web Intents or Protocol Handlers could be used as a simple way of solving
the payment selection NASCAR problem. Instead of showing a large array of
payment providers that are supported by the merchant, a dialog can be shown
instead that only shows the payment mechanisms that are supported by both
the <tref>payer</tref> and the <tref>payee</tref>. A payment provider may
register as one potential handler for a particular intent/protocol scheme,
and when the scheme is invoked, the <tref>payer</tref> is asked which
handler they'd like to use to handle the request.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section> 
      <h2>Data Portability</h2> 
   
      <p>
Require data portability for financial data and credentials that is required 
for core transaction functionality.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Ginger would like to move her banking provider from MehBank to GoodBank. 
She goes to GoodBank and initiates a "Transfer My Account" process. GoodBank
connects to MehBank, with the authorization of Ginger, and pulls her entire
account history, digital receipt data, and balance to MehBank.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section> 
        <h3>Details</h3> 
        <p>
It is often difficult to easily switch financial providers. This will become
more difficult if the use of digital receipts becomes pervasive. If one needs
a digital receipt to prove that a purchase has been made, then the curator
of those digital receipts, like a bank, could use them as a customer 
lock-in mechanism. Therefore, it is important that any information that is
expected to be used in transactions has a provable data portability
story.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section> 
      <h2>Legacy Support</h2> 
   
      <p>
Ensure the Web payments solution can provide an abstraction layer that 
integrates with existing payment methods (eg: VISA, Mastercard, ACH, PayPal, 
debit card, Premium SMS, etc.)
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Harold buys a movie ticket to his local movie theatre via the Web. He is
given a choice of paying with a credit card, PayPal, or Bitcoin. The
digital receipt delivered to the merchant will be in one machine-readable
format to ensure that the merchant can process each type of digital receipt
in a generic fashion.
          </li>
          <li>
Reece gets a weekly share of vegetables through a community-supported
agriculture initiative. He may choose to pay using fiat money, or 
via work credits based on the number of hours he's worked on the farm.
He pays in work credits, which is a hyper-local currency issued by
the community-supported agriculture program. The digital receipt format
only differs in the type of currency that was used to complete the sale.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section> 
        <h3>Details</h3> 
        <p>
In order for the Web Payments initiative to be successful, it must not
discriminate based upon payment instrument or currency. As many types of
payment instrument as possible should be supported.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section> 
      <h2>Authorization Configurability</h2> 
   
      <p>
Allow payment processors to define the required level of authorization for 
particular transactions based on their preferences and local regulations. 
For example: No auth for small amounts, PIN auth for medium amounts, 
Secure Element for large amounts.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Sven buys a single play for an online video game. His payment processor
allows the purchase with no authorization due to the low value of the
transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
Joyce initiates a monthly mortgage payment. She is asked to verify the
purchase using a 2-factor authentication method that she had previously
registered with her payment processor.
          </li>
          <li>
Nimo buys a new car online. He is asked to authorize the purchase by
digitally signing a purchase contract and then using his two-factor
authentication device to verify the transfer of funds.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section> 
        <h3>Details</h3> 
        <p>
There is an important balance between convenience and security that
is typically context-sensitive. It not only depends on the 
situation and the type of transaction, but the payment processor and
the payee's preferences as well. It is important that the type of
authentication used for transaction is left to the entity's involved
in the transaction, and is not hard-coded into the payment protocol.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section> 
      <h2>Smart Contracts</h2> 
   
      <p>
Ensure the technology can be extended or does not prohibit the implementation 
of simple digital contracts and smart contracts.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Quoma owns a small-scale bakery that sells bread to local stores. She
creates a smart contract for pricing goods with her local stores ensuring
that she can make a 20% profit over the input of goods into her bread.
She ties the cost of wheat, energy, and water to the smart contract so that
the price per loaf of bread tracks the market price for the inputs.
          </li>
          <li>
Harim buys a piece of land on a 15 year mortgage. The smart contract that
he executes with the mortgage lender will execute a withdrawal from his
account to the lender's account on a monthly basis.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section> 
        <h3>Details</h3> 
        <p>
Smart contracts, which are typically referenced when discussing 
Distributed Autonomous Organizations, provide the capability of 
algorithmically defining the distribution of economic value. While it is
too early to define a smart contract platform for the Web Payments work,
the creation of such a platform or set of protocols and formats in the
future should not be prevented.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section> 
      <h2>Physical Receipts</h2> 
   
      <p>
Don't prevent a physical version of a digital receipt that can be verified, 
perhaps by printing out a QR Code on a slip of paper with some additional 
information.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3> 
        <ul>
          <li>
Bertrand purchases a bus ticket at a booth using his mobile phone. The digital
receipt for the ticket is printed out on a piece of paper, which he then
takes and presents to a gate with a barcode scanner that scans the ticket
and gives him access to the public transportation building.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section> 
        <h3>Details</h3> 
        <p>
In designing the protocols and formats for the Web Payments work, it is
important that offline-only is taken into account. One manifestation of this
design requirement is the paper receipt or magnetic-stripe ticket.
        </p>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
The following use cases outline scenarios that are targeted to be supported
in the set of Web Payments 1.0 specifications.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h2>Purchase Request</h2> 
   
      <p>
A buyer selects an item to purchase on merchant's site, merchant generates a 
purchase request that will be processed by the buyer's payment processor.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Examples</h3>

      <h2>Transaction Fee Optimization</h2> 
   
      <p>
A buyer discovers an offer for sale by a merchant under terms that the 
merchant is comfortable with. The offer includes a list of payment processors 
that the merchant is capable of receiving payment through. The buyer's 
software contacts a subset of those payment processors that they are capable 
of sending payment through to get finalized transaction details (such as 
price or speed) before executing the most desirable transaction.
