      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This document describes a number of classes and properties that can be used to
express commercial transactions on the Semantic Web. These include things
such as deposits, withdrawals, how entities should be paid for goods or
services rendered, receipts, payment information, recording detailed 
commercial transactions, and digital signatures on monetary transactions.
Where GoodRelations provides a means for finding product offerings or
expressing product needs, this vocabulary can be used for the next step:
recording and expressing the commercial transaction.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
This entire document is a work in progress and is thus incredibly
incomplete and unstable. Like Jello, it MUST NOT be used for any production 
use. Like any unstable financial system, it may result in great financial 
loss or great financial gain. With your luck, it will most probably be the 
former. You have been warned.

        <h3>PayeeRule</h3>
          <p>
A Payee Rule is a mechanism that can describe limits and allowances on the 
payees during a transaction. These rules are typically used to apply 
algorithmic formulas to the final price of a particular good. For example,
minimum and maximum prices, tax rates, when taxes are applied, and preventing
additional payees are a few examples of the types of payee rules that can be
specified using PayeeRules.

        typeof="rdf:Property">
        <h3>Cumulative</h3>
        <p>
This constant term is used to specify a cumulative rate context in a Payee. 
Normally a percentage-based Payee's amount would be calculated by applying its 
percentage rate to the total of all flat amount Payees from the Payee list. By 
specifying that a Payee uses cumulative rate context, the total amount will also 
include amounts calculated for other percentage-based Payees that appear in 
positions prior to the Payee with the cumulative rate context. Therefore, the 
more ExclusivePercentage Payees that appear before a cumulative Payee, the 
larger the total will be that the percentage is applied to in order to calculate 
its amount.

      <section id="Deferred" about="http://purl.org/commerce#Deferred"
        typeof="rdf:Property">
        <h3>Deferred</h3>
        <p>
This constant term is used to specify a deferred rate context. A deferred
rate context specifies that the amount of a percentage-based Payee must be 
calculated after all non-deferred Payee amounts have already been calculated. 
This is most useful when a Payee should be applied to the total cost of a good 
or service. Whilst Payees that are Taxes are automatically deferred, if a Payee 
that is not a Tax wishes to behave like one, it should use this rate context.

        typeof="rdf:Property">
        <h3>ExclusivePercentage</h3>
        <p>
This constant term is used to specify an exclusive percentage-based rate type.
An exclusive percentage-based rate type specifies that the rate is a percentage
and the percentage should be applied to the total price of all payees that are
not also percentage-based. There are some exceptions to this rule when using a 
cumulative rate context (see: Cumulative). The amount that results from this 
percentage will be added to the total amount calculated from all of the Payees. 
This behavior is the opposite of that of an InclusivePercentage, where the total 
would not be altered. Real world examples of ExclusivePercentages include most 
sales taxes in the United States.

        <h3>InclusivePercentage</h3>
        <p>
This constant term is used to specify an inclusive percentage-based rate type.
An inclusive percentage-based rate type specifies that the rate is a percentage
and the percentage should be applied to the total price of all payees that are
not also percentage-based. There are some exceptions to this rule when using 
a cumulative rate context (see: Cumulative). The amount that results from 
this percentage will be evenly deducted from all other Payees, thus leaving 
the total the same. This behavior is the opposite of that of an 
ExclusivePercentage, where the amount would be added to the total and the 
other Payees would remain the same. Real world examples of InclusivePercentages 
include most income taxes in the United States.
