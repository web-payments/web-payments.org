The freedom to transact and exchange value has become an important cornerstone
of the Web. This specification outlines a browser 
<a href="http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/">polyfill</a>
that makes financial transactions easier to initiate and verify while also 
making them more secure. The solution is designed to work with both proprietary
(PayPal, Google Wallet) and non-proprietary (PaySwarm, Bitcoin, Ripple)
payment solutions.

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
This API enables a web application to initiate payment for a product or 
service by calling a <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> method. The
implementation of this feature is expected to be provided by a JavaScript
polyfill at first, and if deployment is successful, native browser 
implementations will eventually surface to enhance usability and transaction 
security.

<section>
  <h2>Payment Flow Overview</h2>
  <p>
A web app running on the vendor's website will interact with a 
<tref>payment provider</tref> via <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code>.
Results of the payment request will be POSTed to the vendor's server.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
The app initiates a payment by calling <code>navigator.transact.pay(request)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
This starts the buyflow by POSTing a purchase request to the payment provider.
The payment provider is either the vendor-provided default, or a payment 
provider specified by the customer.
    </li>
    <li>
A purchasing flow is served from the payment provider as an HTML5 document 
inside a dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
The buyer is authenticated by the payment provider.
    </li>
    <li>
The buyer accepts or cancels the purchase.
    </li>
    <li>
A callback is called on the vendor's page that notfies the vendors software
that the purchase was successful, or canceled.
    </li>
    <li>
The vendor software receives a digital receipt of the sale and may then 
verify whether or not the payment was processed successfully.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
The diagram below outlines the basic payment flow described above.

<section>
  <h2>Detailed Payment Flow</h2>
  <p class="issue">
Describe the payment flow in detail here. Primarily, express how this approach
utilizes a mechanism like Persona to deploy the API on websites using a 
centralized service and then decentralize the payment mechanism through the
implementation of the dialog via a Web browser.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Buyer Registration and Login</h3>
    <p>
This is an implementation detail of the <tref>payment provider</tref>.
The <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> API does not prescribe any user
authorization scheme.
    </p>
    <p class="issue">
Specify user identity management, 
e.g. <a href="https://login.persona.org/">Persona</a>, and describe how 
Persona coupled with the Web Identity specification can be used to discover
a customer's payment provider.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Vendor Registration</h3>
    <p>
This is an implementation detail of the <tref>payment provider</tref>.
The <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> API facilities two parties in 
executing a transaction: 1) a <tref>buyer</tref> and 2) a <tref>vendor</tref>.  
It does not facilitate any part of the registration process.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>The Payment Request</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The <tref>buyer</tref> navigates to a vendor's website.</li>
      <li>
The <tref>buyer</tref> finds something interesting to purchase, like a one
year subscription to a blog.
      </li>
      <li>
The <tref>buyer</tref> clicks a <strong>Buy</strong> button.
      </li>
      <li>
The application generates a purchase request, which is a [[!JSON-LD]] object 
that contains the minimum amount of information for the payment provider to
perform discovery on the product price and other information such as
name, description, price, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
The <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> method is called with the 
purchase request. This begins the payment provider buy flow 
inside a dialog in the user agent.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <pre class="example" title="Example of a purchase request">
var purchaseRequest = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  paymentProvider: 'https://paymentprovider.com/transact',
  listing: 'https://example.com/products/test#listing',
  listingHash: '1ecd90db01ba293d097c713150defffa5e38bdabbe56e8950e4b354f514c7018',
  paymentCallback: 'https://store.com/digital-receipts?nonce=2f73a2j'
}
    </pre>
    <p>
Here is a detailed explanation of the purchase request:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>paymentProvider (mandatory)</dt>
      <dd>
The payment provider URL to use when initiating the transaction. The purchase
request will be POSTed to this location.
      </dd>
      <dt>listing (mandatory)</dt>
      <dd>
A URL for the identifier of the product listing (product and pricing 
information).
      </dd>
      <dt>listingHash</dt>
      <dd>
A SHA-256 hash of the listing if the vendor would like to ensure that the listing
that is fetched matches the hash that they generated. Warning: This isn't
completely collision proof, but it's very good protection as long as the
size of the listing is limited to less than 512Kb. (We need to calculate 
max listing sizes that protect against collision attacks on SHA-256).
      </dd>
      <dt>paymentCallback (mandatory)</dt>
      <dd>
The callback that will be called with the result of the purchase, either a
digital receipt or a cancelation reason.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
For a user to make a purchase, the Application must execute the Javascript
method <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> with the listing. 
For example, the app might have a 'buy' button that
triggers this method when clicked.
    </p>

    <pre class="example" title="Initiating a payment via the navigator.transact.pay() method">
navigator.transact.pay(purchaseRequest);
    </pre>

    <ol>
      <li>
The <code>navigator.transact.pay</code> method will POST the purchase
request to the payment provider and the result will be shown in a dialog,
so the buyer can confirm payment.
      </li>
      <li>
The details of the exact buy flow are implemented by the
<tref>payment provider</tref>.
      </li>
      <li>
The buyer confirms the purchase or cancels it.
      </li>
      <li>
If the buyer cancels or something goes wrong with the payment process, an
error is posted to the callback
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>The Digital Receipt</h3>
    <p>
The user agent will POST a digital receipt to the 
<strong>paymentCallback</strong> if the payment is successful. If
the payment is not successful, an error will be posted to the 
<strong>paymentCallback</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
When a digital receipt is received, the application must verify the signature. 
If the signature is not valid, it should be ignored. If the signature is valid,
the application should grant the buyer access to the item they purchased.
    </p>
    <p class="issue">
The vendor is going to have to have a whitelist of some sort to understand
which payment processors' signatures it trusts on digital receipts. For example,
perhaps PayPal, Google Wallet, and Amazon will be in a whitelist. This creates
undue advantage to those organizations, so a generalized whitelist is going to
be necessary if the system is going to scale to thousands of payment 
processors. This will most likely require some sort of regulatory body that
approves payment processors (ensures that they've met some sort of fiduciary
criteria).
    </p>

    <p>
Here is an example of a callback POSTed to the <strong>purchaseCallback</strong> 
that indicates a transaction was fully processed and was successful:
    </p>
    <pre class="example" title="Digital receipt postback example">{

  <h2>The Application Programming Interface</h2>

  <p class="issue">
This browser-based API is provided for convenience purposes only. The 
existence of the API is absolutely not a requirement for the basic operation
of the Web Payments protocol. No browser API is necessary in order for a
Web application to initiate payment and receive a digital receipt of the
result of the payment.
  </p>

  <p>This API provides a clean mechanism that enables developers to 
    initiate payments in a <tref>User Agent</tref>. 
    A conformant Payment Initator MUST implement the entirety of the 
    following API.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>NavigatorTransactions</h3>

    <p>Navigator Transactions is the name of the high-level programming 
      interface that Web developers use to initiate payments. If MUST be
      made available via the <code>navigator.transact</code> object.</p>

    <dl title="interface NavigatorTransactions" class="idl">
      <dt>DOMRequest pay()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
Initiates a payment or refund given an array of [[!JSON-LD]] encoded payment 
requests describing the type of financial operations to perform.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
Should we break refunds out into their own method call? The downside of doing
that is that the API is no longer fairly generic. However, .pay() doesn't
really imply "refund", unless you think of a refund like a reverse payment?
The other thing we could do is use .process() or .transact() as the method
call and change the interface name to something like 
navigator.funds.transact() or navigator.wallet.transact().
        </p>
        <p>
Each request object will contain a <code>typ</code> key. The value associated
with this key will be used to perform matchmaking between the customer's list 
of registered payment providers and the list of preferred payment providers 
for the Merchant. Typically, a <tref>User Agent</tref> will 
request that the customer rank their registered payment providers in most 
preferable to least preferable order. If this ranking is performed, 
a payment provider can be selected automatically by picking highest ranked
payment provider in the customer's payment provider list with a payment 
provider that also exists in the Merchant's payment provider list. 
        </p>
        <dl class="parameters">
          <dt>object[] requests</dt>
          <dd>An array of [[!JSON-LD]] encoded payment requests describing 
          the type of financial operations to perform.</dd>
